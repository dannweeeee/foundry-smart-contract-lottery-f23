# Random Raffle Contracts

## About

This code is to create a random smart contract lottery.

## What we want it to do?

1. Users can enter by paying for a ticket
* The ticket fees are going to go to the winner during the draw
2. After X period of time, the lottery will automatically draw a winner
* And this will be done programatically
3. Using Chainlink VRF & Chainlink Automation
* Chainlink VRF -> Randomness
* Chainlink Automation -> Time-based trigger

## Tests

1. Write some deploy scripts
2. Write our tests
* Work on a local chain
* Forked Testnnet
* Forked Mainnet
